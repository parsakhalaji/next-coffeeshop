# Next CoffeeShop

Welcome to Next CoffeeShop! This repository contains the code for a coffee shop website built using Next.js framework. The website utilizes Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Swiper for a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Built with Next.js, a React framework for production-grade applications.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Certain parts of the website are rendered on the client side for fast initial page loads and dynamic content.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Other parts of the website are rendered on the server side for improved SEO and performance.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Allows certain pages to be statically generated at build time and then updated in the background as needed for dynamic content.
- **Swiper**: Integrated Swiper for a modern and responsive image slider for showcasing products or promotions.
